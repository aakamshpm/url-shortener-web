# ZipLink Frontend

This is the frontend UI for [ZipLink](https://github.com/aakamshpm/ziplink), a scalable URL shortener service.  
The primary purpose of this frontend is to **showcase the backend system design and API** built in the companion repository, as well as to serve as a learning project for Angular.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

- **Demonstrate the ZipLink Backend:**  
  This UI connects to and showcases the scalable backend and API design available in the [ZipLink backend repository](https://github.com/aakamshpm/ziplink).
- **Showcase Angular Skills:**  
  The frontend is built with [Angular](https://angular.io/). It's my first major Angular project, created to help me learn and demonstrate modern Angular practices, component design, forms, state management, and API integration.
