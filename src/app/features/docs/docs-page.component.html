        ZipLink: Not Just Another URL Shortener
      </h1>

      <div class="prose prose-gray max-w-none">
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">
          When I started building ZipLink, my goal wasn't to add yet another
          clone to the endless list of URL shorteners out there. Instead, I
          wanted a playground—a real-world system that would push me to learn,
          experiment, and truly understand what it takes to design backends that
          don't just work, but scale.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-medium text-gray-900 mb-4">
          Why ZipLink isn't just a clone:
        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Most URL shorteners are simple: take a link, store it, generate a
          code, redirect. ZipLink is fundamentally about reliability,
          throughput, and growth. I focused on system design patterns used by
          production teams, not just hobby projects.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-medium text-gray-900 mb-4">
          What I learned and built:
        </h2>
        <ul
          class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-gray-600 font-light mb-6"
        >
          <li>
            <strong class="font-medium text-gray-900"
              >Batch-wise ID allocation:</strong
            >
            Instead of incrementing the DB for every new URL, ZipLink grabs a
            batch of IDs at once. This minimizes DB writes and enables
            horizontal scaling with no risk of duplicate codes, even when
            multiple app instances are running.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="font-medium text-gray-900"
              >Cache-first architecture:</strong
            >
            Fast redirects are powered by Redis, keeping the DB cool and
            response times low. Newly created and hot URLs are cached
            automatically.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="font-medium text-gray-900"
              >Async analytics pipeline:</strong
            >
            Click events go to a Redis buffer and are flushed to the database in
            batches by a scheduled job, reducing write pressure and smoothing
            spikes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="font-medium text-gray-900"
              >Rate limiting and validation:</strong
            >
            Both URL creation and redirects are rate-limited to guard against
            abuse. Strict input checks and security headers are enforced
            everywhere.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="font-medium text-gray-900"
              >Stateless and container-ready:</strong
            >
            Everything is Dockerized, making it easy to scale, deploy, and reset
            environments.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="font-medium text-gray-900"
              >Modern developer experience:</strong
            >
            TypeScript, NestJS, Prisma, and robust OpenAPI docs (Swagger) make
            the codebase clean and extensible.
          </li>
        </ul>

            I'm not afraid to go deeper than the tutorial layer. I dig into
            trade-offs, edge cases, and production-like challenges.
          </li>
          <li>
            I care about performance, reliability, and security, not just
            features.
          </li>
          <li>
            I can design, build, and document scalable cloud-ready systems using
            modern stacks.
          </li>
          <li>
            I'm comfortable with both the high-level architecture and the
            nitty-gritty of database, caching, and deployment.
          </li>
          <li>
            I value readable code, automation, and a developer-friendly
            experience for myself and others.

          ZipLink was the best way for me to learn how real, scalable systems
          are made—and to prove to myself (and future collaborators/employers)
          that I can design and build them.
